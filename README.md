# Tableau_Story-Global_Suicide_Rates

## Introduction 

I have created a Tableau story to explore and provide insights into the rising rates of suicides in the United States. Additionally, I aimed to shed light on the gender disparities in suicide, emphasizing that men are more likely than women to take their own lives. The objective of this visualization is to offer users a comprehensive understanding of suicide rates globally, not confined solely to the United States. Through this Tableau story, users can discern the substantial differences in suicide rates between men and women across various regions, contributing to a more informed perspective on this critical issue.

## Data Preparation

In preparing my data, I acquired the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016. This dataset encompasses various metrics, including country, age, sex, year, population, suicide rates, HDI, and GDP per capita.
